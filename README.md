Prerequisites:
- Python 3 (tested on Python 3.9)
- Java JDK 17 (this is required by one of the Python packages, tabula-py, which is a wrapper of a Java library)

Setup:
- Move into `src` directory: `cd src`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `process_schedule_of_notices_of_leases.py`

Output:
There are debugging lines printed to stdout to show the current progress.
The final output file is output.json. However, due to time constraints with this exercise, this is only a partial solution.
